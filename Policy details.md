# Policy: Monthly Application of SARS Medical Scheme Fees Tax Credit via Payroll

Version: 1.0  
Owner: Finance  
Effective: [Insert date]

---

## 1) Purpose
Enable eligible employees to receive the SARS Medical Scheme Fees Tax Credit monthly via payroll, improving net pay while ensuring compliance with South African tax law and POPIA.

## 2) Scope
- Applies to all employees of Special Effects Media who contribute to a registered South African medical scheme or pay on behalf of a qualifying dependant (spouse/parent).
- Applies to regular payroll runs; not a company contribution.

## 3) Definitions
- __Medical tax credit__: SARS Medical Scheme Fees Tax Credit reducing PAYE. Rates set annually by SARS.
- __Principal member__: The person in whose name the medical scheme membership is registered.
- __Beneficiary__: Principal member or dependant (spouse/child/qualifying parent) listed on the membership.

## 3A) Background: What is the medical tax credit?
- The Medical Scheme Fees Tax Credit is a fixed Rand amount per beneficiary category that __reduces an employee’s PAYE__.
- Typically claimed on the __annual tax return__; this policy allows employees to __apply it monthly via payroll__ instead, improving net pay during the year.
- The monthly benefit depends on the __number of beneficiaries__ (main member, first dependant, and additional dependants). Finance applies the __current SARS rates__.

## 3B) Current SARS monthly credit rates (from 1 March 2025)
- Main member: ZAR 364 per month
- First dependant: ZAR 364 per month
- Each additional dependant: ZAR 246 per month

Worked example
- Family of 4 (main member + spouse + 2 children): 364 + 364 + (2 × 246) = ZAR 1,220 monthly reduction in PAYE.

> Rates are set by SARS and reviewed annually. Finance must update payroll rate tables when SARS publishes changes.

## 4) Eligibility criteria
Employees are eligible when all of the following are met:
- Employee is a beneficiary on a registered SA medical scheme; and
- EITHER: Employee is the __principal (main) member or an adult dependant__ and __pays the contributions from their own bank account__; OR Employee __pays on behalf of a spouse/qualifying parent__ from their own account; and
- Where paying on behalf of a spouse/parent, the __principal member does not claim__ the credit for the same period; and
- Valid supporting documents are provided and verified by Finance.

> Note: The monthly credit applied in payroll is determined by the verified __beneficiary count__ and the applicable __SARS credit rates__ for the tax year.

## 5) Required documentation
- Current membership certificate listing beneficiaries.
- Proof of payment by employee (recent bank statement or proof of deduction) showing payer and medical scheme.
- ID copies: employee and principal member (if different).
- Declaration that information is accurate and that changes will be reported immediately.

## 6) Process
1. Employee submits details and documents via Monday.com form.
2. Finance verifies eligibility, beneficiaries, payer, and duplicates.
3. Finance confirms SARS credit rate set for the tax year and beneficiary count.
4. Payroll applies monthly credits from the first feasible pay run after approval and before cut‑off.
5. Finance records decision and effective month; notifies employee.

## 7) Effective date and changes
- Credits start from approval month or next payroll cycle after cut‑off; no retrospective application unless mandated by Finance and lawful.
- Employees must notify Finance __immediately__ of any changes to membership, beneficiaries, payer, scheme, or cancellation.
- Credits are adjusted or suspended from the effective change date.

## 8) Duplicate claims and conflicts
- Only one taxpayer may claim a dependant in a period. Where another person (e.g., spouse/parent) claims the same dependant, payroll credits will be stopped and prior months may be reversed. SARS may reconcile at assessment.

## 9) Audit, review, and spot checks
- Finance may perform audits, request additional proof, or suspend credits pending verification.
- Annual re-validation may be required.

## 10) Privacy and data protection (POPIA)
- Documents are processed solely to administer payroll tax credits.
- Access restricted to Finance/Payroll. Data stored securely on approved systems.
- Retention: minimum 5 years for audit/compliance, then securely destroyed.

## 11) Governance and ownership
- Policy owner: Head of Finance. Process owners: Finance and Payroll managers.
- SARS rates updates: Finance updates rate tables each tax year and communicates changes.

## 12) Exceptions
- Any exception must be approved in writing by Head of Finance and documented with rationale.

## 13) Consequences of misuse
- Providing false information or failing to report changes may result in reversal of credits, SARS liabilities, and disciplinary action.
