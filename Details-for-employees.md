Special Effects Media will start applying the SARS Medical Scheme Fees Tax Credit ("medical tax credit") through payroll each month for eligible employees. This means you get the benefit monthly instead of waiting for your annual tax return.

> Note: This is not an additional company contribution. It’s a SARS tax credit that reduces your PAYE each month if you qualify.

## What this means
- __Monthly cash‑in‑pocket__: Your PAYE is reduced by the value of the medical tax credit you qualify for, increasing your net pay.
- __No change to your medical aid payment__: You keep paying your medical scheme as usual.
- __Year-end reconciliation__: SARS still reconciles everything at assessment. Any over/under-claim will be handled by SARS when you file.

## What is a medical tax credit?
- The SARS Medical Scheme Fees Tax Credit is a fixed amount per month that __reduces the PAYE tax you owe__.
- Most people only receive this credit when they file their __annual tax return__.
- With this initiative, you can __opt in__ to apply the same credit __monthly via payroll__, so you feel the benefit in your take‑home pay now.

### How much will I save each month?
- Your monthly PAYE reduction depends on the __number of beneficiaries__ on your medical scheme:
  - Main member credit
  - First dependant credit
  - A smaller fixed credit for __each additional dependant__
- SARS updates these amounts each tax year. __Finance will calculate your exact monthly reduction__ using the latest SARS rates and the beneficiary count on your membership certificate.

---

## Who qualifies
You may qualify if any of the following apply:
- __You are the principal (main) member or an adult dependant__ on a registered South African medical scheme, and __you pay the contributions from your own bank account__.
- __You pay the medical aid on someone else’s behalf__ (e.g., spouse or qualifying parent) from your own bank account, and the __principal member does not claim__ the credit in their own tax return for the same period.
- You can provide __proof of payment__ and __proof of membership/beneficiaries__.

> We’ll use the latest SARS medical scheme fees tax credit rates for the current tax year. Finance will update rates when SARS updates them each year.

## How the monthly credit is calculated
- SARS sets a __fixed monthly tax credit__ per beneficiary category each tax year.
- Your monthly PAYE is reduced by: `credit for main member + credit for first dependant + credit per additional dependant`.
- __Example (illustrative only; Finance will use current SARS rates)__:
  - If you have 1 main member + 1 spouse + 2 children, your monthly PAYE reduction = `Rate(Main) + Rate(Dep 1) + 2 × Rate(Other deps)`.
  - Your net pay increases by the same amount.

> The credit is independent of the actual premium amount (subject to SARS rules). It does not change your gross salary.

---

## Current SARS monthly credit rates (from 1 March 2025)
- __Main member__: ZAR 364 per month
- __First dependant__: ZAR 364 per month
- __Each additional dependant__: ZAR 246 per month

__Worked example__
- Family of 4 (you + spouse + 2 children): 364 + 364 + (2 × 246) = __ZAR 1,220__ monthly reduction in PAYE; net pay increases by the same amount.

> Rates are set by SARS and reviewed annually. Finance updates these in payroll when SARS updates them.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
- __Does the company contribute to my medical aid?__  No. We’re just facilitating the SARS credit via payroll.
- __Will I get less at tax season?__  No loss of benefit—this simply brings the credit forward monthly. SARS will reconcile at assessment.
- __What if I change my scheme/beneficiaries?__  Tell Finance immediately. Credits will be adjusted from the effective date.
- __Can I claim for a parent or spouse I pay for?__  Yes, if you pay from your account and the principal member does not claim the credit themselves.
- __What if both I and my spouse work?__  Only one person can claim the same dependant in a period. Coordinate to avoid duplicate claims.
- __What happens if I stop paying?__  The credit stops from the change date and any over-claim will be corrected by SARS at assessment.
